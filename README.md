Scores for your cards follow these rules:
• If it’s a face card (the Jack, the Queen or the King), it counts as 0.5.
• Otherwise, the numeral-itself of the card, that is, 6 of Spades counts as 6, 2 of Hearts as 2.
For example:
• 5 of Hearts, Jack of Spades and Queen of Clubs sum to 6 since 6=5+0.5 + 0.5
• 2 of Diamonds, 5 of Hearts and King of Diamonds sum to 7.5, since 7.5 = 2 + 5 + 0.5
• 3 of Hearts, 2 of Diamonds and 5 of Diamonds sum to 10, since 10 = 3 + 2 + 5 
You win double of your bet if you get 7.5. You lose 20% of your bet if you get closer. You lose all the bet if your 
score exceeds 7.5.
